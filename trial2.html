            <span class="funfact-heading"> 🌸She’s a florophile who is a florophobe:</span>
          she really loves flowers especially when she’s  gifted some indeed she is a flower.
            Red Roses🌹 are her favourite type of flowers yet the irony behind this is
            she has a certain dislike to flowery scents be it on her shower gels or body lotion.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="funfact-heading">😸 She Has a very funny food combinations: </span>
            she can take fresh milk alongside an Apple.Rice and beans with some skuma on top.
            indomie mixed with avocado. A boilt egg wrapped in a chapati.

            </P>
            She is a sleepimg beauty,she can set up to five alarm intervals and yet turn them off as they go off.Falls asleep faster than i can say"i love you"
            its honestly the cutest thing how she can drift off and still look peaceful.I tease her about being a professional napper but truth is i love watching her sleep.

          <span class="funfact-heading">🎤 Can remember the lyrics to almost any song after hearing it:</span>
            she has an exceptional memory for music, she can remember the lyrics to almost any song after hearing it
            just once or atleast twice. It’s something that comes naturally to her and helps her enjoy music even more.

          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="funfact-heading">✨Emotinal eater:</span>she’s an emotional eater,she eats alot when she’s stressed,
            she always has this trick up her sleave and it actually helps her cope with  stress.
          </p>
          <P>
            <span class="funfact-heading">🫖Taking tea is literally her cup of tea:</span>
            She ought to be nicknamed "ketepa" because she can take tea (caramel tea) like no ones business,she’s yet to be
            hosting tea parties at this point ,tea helps her take off the edge, it helps her feel relaxed and happy.
            She always closes her day with a mug or two.
          </P>
          <p>
            <span class="funfact-heading">🐇She has a liking to kittens but never cats:</span>
            her love towards kittens or anything cute may it be a puppy,chick or piglet is of profuse extent
            surprisingly she has a disliking to the full-grown adults of the respective species.
